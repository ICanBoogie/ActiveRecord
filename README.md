# Active Record [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ICanBoogie/ActiveRecord.png?branch=2.1)](http://travis-ci.org/ICanBoogie/ActiveRecord)

As described by Martin Flower, an active record "carries both data and behavior. Much of this
data is persistent and needs to be stored in a database. Active Record uses the most obvious
approach, putting data access logic in the domain object. This way all people know how
to read and write their data to and from the database."

__Connections__, __models__ and __active records__ are the foundations of everything that concerns
database access and management. They are used to establish database connections, manage tables and
their possible relationship, as well as manage the records of these tables. Leveraging OOP, the
models and active records are instances which properties, getters/setters and behavior can be
inherited in a business logic.

Using the __query interface__, you won't have to write raw SQL, manage table relationship,
or worry about injection.

Finally, using __providers__ you can define all your connections and models in a single place.
Connections are established and models are instantiated on demand, so feel free the define
hundreds of them.





### Acknowledgements

The implementation of the query interface is vastly inspired by
[Ruby On Rails's Active Record Query Interface](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html).





## Establishing a connection to a database

A connection to a database is created with a [Connection](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.Connection.html)
instance.

The following code establishes a connection to a MySQL database:

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord\Connection;

$connection = new Connection('mysql:dbname=example', 'username', 'password');
```

The `Connection` class extends `PDO`. It takes the same parameters, and custom options can
be provided with the driver options to specify a prefix to table names, specify the charset and
collate of the connection or its timezone.





### Prefixing database tables

The `#table_name_prefix` option specifies the prefix for all the tables name of the connection.
Thus, if the `icybee` prefix is defined the `nodes` table is renamed as `icybee_nodes`.

The `{table_name_prefix}` placeholder is replaced in queries by the prefix:

```php
<?php

$stmt = $connection('SELECT * FROM `{table_name_prefix}nodes` LIMIT 10');
```





### Charset and collate of strings

The `#charset` and `#collate` options specify the charset and the collate of the connection.

The `{charset}` and `{collate}` placeholders are replaced in queries:

```php
<?php

$connection('ALTER TABLE nodes CHARACTER SET "{charset}" COLLATE "{collate}"');
```




### Specifying a time zone

The `#timezone` option specifies the time zone of the connection.





## Models overview

A _model_ is an object-oriented representation of a database table, or a group of tables.
A model is used to create, update, delete and query records. Models are instances of the [Model](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.Model.html)
class, and usually implement a specific business logic.

```php
<?php

namespace Website\Nodes;

class Model extends \ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord\Model
{
	// â€¦
}

$model = new Nodes
([
	Model::CONNECTION => $connection,
	Model::ACTIVERECORD_CLASS => __NAMESPACE__ . '\Node',
	Model::NAME => 'node',
	Model::SCHEMA => [

		'fields' => [

			'id' => 'serial',
			'title' => [ 'varchar', 80 ],
			'number' => [ 'integer', 'unsigned' => true ]
		]
	]
]);
```





### Database connection

The `CONNECTION` key specifies the database connection, an instance of the [Connection](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.Connection.html)
class.





### Active Record class

The `ACTIVERECORD_CLASS` key specifies the class used to instantiate the active records of the
model.





### Name of the table

The `NAME` key specifies the name of the table. If a table prefix is defined by the connection,
it is used to prefix the table name. The `name` and `unprefixed_name` properties returns the
prefixed name and original name of the table:

```php
<?php

echo "table name: {$model->name}, original: {$model->unprefixed_name}.";
```

The `{self}` placeholder is replaced in queries by the `name` property:

```php
<?php

$stmt = $model('SELECT * FROM `{self}` LIMIT 10');
```





### Schema

The columns and properties of the table are defined with a schema, which is specified by the
`SCHEMA` attribute.

The `fields` key specifies the columns of the table. A key defines the name of the column, and a
value defines the properties of the column. Most column types use the following basic definition
pattern:

```
'<identifier>' => '<type_and_default_options>'
# or
'<identifier>' => [ '<type>', <size> ];
```

The following types are available: `blob`, `char`, `integer`, `text`, `varchar`,
`bit`, `boolean`, `date`, `datetime`, `time`, `timestamp`, `year`, `enum`, `double` et `float`. The
`serial` and `foreign` special types are used to defined auto incrementing primary keys and foreign
keys:

```php
<?php

[
	'nid' => 'serial', // bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY (`nid`)
	'uid' => 'foreign' // bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL, KEY `uid` (`uid`)
];
```

The size of the field can be defined as an integer for the `blob`, `char`, `integer`, `varchar` and
`bit` types:

```php
<?php

[
	'title' => 'varchar', // varchar(255) NOT NULL
	'slug' => [ 'varchar', 80 ], // varchar(80) NOT NULL
	'weight' => 'integer', // int(11) NOT NULL
	'small_count' => [ 'integer', 8 ] // int(8) NOT NULL,
	'price' => [ 'float', [ 10, 3 ] ] // float(10,3) NOT NULL
];
```

The size of the field can be defined using the qualifiers `tiny`, `small`, `medium`,
`big` or `long` for the `blob`, `char`, `integer`, `text` and `varchar` types:

```php
<?php

[
	'body' => [ 'text', 'long' ] // longtext NOT NULL
];
```

The qualifier `null` specifies that a field can be null, by default fields are not capable
of receiving the `null`:

```
[ 'varchar', 'null' => true ] // varchar(255)
[ 'integer', 'null' => true ] // int(11)
[ 'integer' ] // int(11) NOT NULL
```

The qualifier `unsigned` specifies that a numeric value is not signed:

```
[ 'integer' ] // int(11)
[ 'integer', 'unsigned' => true ] // int(10) unsigned
```

The qualifier `indexed` specifies that a field should be indexed:

```php
[
	'slug' => [ 'varchar', 'indexed' => true ], // varchar(255) NOT NULL, KEY `slug` (`slug`)
	'is_online' => [ 'boolean', 'indexed' => true ] // tinyint(1) NOT NULL, KEY `is_online` (`is_online`),

	'pageid' => [ 'foreign', 'indexed' => 'page-content' ], // bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL
	'contentid' => [ 'foreign', 'indexed' => 'page-content' ], // bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL, KEY `page-content` (`pageid`, `contentid`)
];
```

The qualifier `primary` specifies that a column is a primary key. A multi-column primary key is
created if multiple columns have the `primary` qualifier:

```php
[
	'vtid' => [ 'foreign', 'primary' => true ],
	'nid' => [ 'foreign', 'primary' => true ],
	'weight' => [ 'integer', 'unsigned' => true ]
];

// ADD PRIMARY KEY ( `vtid` , `nid` )
```




### Creating the table associated with a model

Once the model has been defined, its associated table can easily be created with the `install()`
method.

```php
<?php

$model->install();
```

The `is_installed()` method checks if a model has already been installed.

Note: The method only checks if the corresponding table exists, not if its schema is correct.

```php
<?php

if ($model->is_installed())
{
	echo "The model is already installed.";
}
```




### Placeholders

The following placeholders are replaced in model queries:

* `{alias}`: The alias of the table.
* `{prefix}`: The prefix of the table names of the connection.
* `{primary}`: The primary key of the table.
* `{self}`: The name of the table.
* `{self_and_related}`: The escaped name of the table and the possible JOIN clauses.





## Relations

### Extending another model

A model can extend another, just like a class can extend another in PHP. Fields are inherited
and the primary key of the parent is used to link records together. When the model is queried, the
tables are joined. When values are inserted or updated, they are split to update the various
tables. Also, the connection of the parent model is inherited.

The `EXTENDING` attribute specifies the model to extend.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord\Model;

$nodes = new Model
([
	Model::NAME => 'nodes',
	Model::CONNECTION => $connection,
	Model::SCHEMA => [

		'fields' => [

			'nid' => 'serial',
			'title' => 'varchar'
		]
	]
]);

$news = new Model
([
	Model::NAME => 'news',
	Model::EXTENDING => $nodes,
	Model::SCHEMA => [

		'fields' => [

			'date' => 'date'
		]
	]
]);

$news->save([ 'title' => 'Testing!', 'date' => '2013-02-16' ]);
```





### Belong to

Records of a model can belong to records of other models. For instance, a news article belonging
to a user. The relation is specified with the `BELONGS_TO` attribute. When the _belongs to_
relation is specified, a getter is automatically added to the prototype of the records. For
instance, if records of a `news` model belong to records of a `users` model, than the `get_user`
getter is added to the prototype of the records of the `news` model. The user of a news record
can then by obtained using the magic property `user`.

```php
<?php

$news = new Model
([
	Model::NAME => 'news',
	Model::EXTENDING => $nodes,
	Model::BELONGS_TO => $users,
	Model::SCHEMA => [

		'fields' => [

			'date' => 'date',
			'uid' => 'foreign'
		]
	]
]);

$record = $news->one;

echo "{$record->title} belongs to {$record->user->name}.";
```





## Active Records

An active record is an object-oriented representation of a record in a database. Usually, the
table columns are its public properties and it is not unusual that getters/setters and business
logic methods are implemented by an active record class.

```php
<?php

namespace Website;

class Node extends \ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord
{
	// â€¦

	protected function get_next()
	{
		return $this->model->own->visible->where('date > ?', $this->date)->order('date')->one;
	}

	protected function get_previous()
	{
		return $this->model->own->visible->where('date < ?', $this->date)->order('date DESC')->one;
	}

	// â€¦
}
```

The active record holds both the data and the business logic. Most of its properties are
persistent and are saved in the database. The `save()` method saves the active record.

```php
<?php

$record = $model[10];
$record->is_online = false;
$record->save();
```

The `delete()` method deletes the active record from the database:

```php
<?php

$record = $model[190];
$record->delete();
```





### Date time properties

The package comes with three trait properties especially designed to handle [DateTime][]
instances: [DateTimeProperty][], [CreatedAtProperty][], [UpdatedAtProperty][]. Using this
properties you are guaranted to always get a [DateTime][] instance, no matter what value type
is used to set the date and time.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord;

class Node extends ActiveRecord
{
	public $title;

	use CreatedAtProperty;
	use UpdatedAtProperty;
}

$node = new Node;

echo get_class($node->created_at);   // ICanBoogie\Datetime
echo $node->created_at->is_empty;    // true
$node->created_at = 'now';
echo $node->created_at;              // 2014-02-21T15:00:00+0100
```





## Query Interface

The query interface provides different ways to retrieve data from the database. Using the query
interface you can find records using a variety of methods and conditions; specify the order,
fields, grouping, limit, or the tables to join; use dynamic or scoped filters; check the existence
or particular records; perform various calculations.

Queries often starts from a model, in the following examples the `$model` variable is a reference
to a model managing _nodes_.





### Retrieving records from the database

To retrieve objects and values from the database several finder methods are provided. Each of these
methods defines the fragments of the database query. Complex queries can be created without having
to write any raw SQL.

The methods are:

* where
* select
* group
* having
* order
* limit
* offset
* joins

All of the above methods return a [Query](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.Query.html)
instance, allowing you to chain them.

Records can be retrieved in various ways, especially using the `all`, `one`, `pairs` or `rc`
magic properties. The `find()` methodâ€”used to retrieve a single record or a set of recordsâ€”is the
most simple of them.





#### Retrieving a single record

Retrieving a single record using its primary key is really simple. You can either use the `find()`
method of the model, or use the model as an array.

```php
<?php

$article = $model->find(10);

# or

$article = $model[10];
```





#### Retrieving a set of records

Retrieving a set or records using their primary key is really simple too:

```php
<?php

$articles = $model->find([ 10, 32, 89 ]);

# or

$articles = $model->find(10, 32, 89);
```

The [RecordNotFound](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.RecordNotFound.html)
exception is thrown when a record could not be found. Its `records` property
can be used to know which records could be found and which could not.

Note: The records of the set are returned in the same order they are requested, this also applies
to the `records` property of the [RecordNotFound](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.RecordNotFound.html)
exception.





#### Records caching

Records retrived using `find()` are cached, they are reused by subsequent calls. This also
applies to the array notation.

```php
<?php

$article = $model[12]; // '12' retrieved from database
$articles = $model->find(11, 12, 13); // '11' and '13' retrieved from database, '12' is reused.
```





### Conditions

The `where()` method specifies the conditions used to filter the records. It represents
the `WHERE`-part of the SQL statement. Conditions can either be specified as a string, as a
list of arguments or as an array.





#### Conditions specified as a string

Adding a condition to a query can be as simple as `$model->where('is_online = 1');`. This
would return all the records where the `is_online` field equals "1".

__Warning:__ Building you own conditions as string can leave you vulnerable to SQL injection
exploits. For instance, `$model->where('is_online = ' . $_GET['online']);` is not safe. Always
use placeholders when you can't trust the source of your inputs:

```php
<?php

$model->where('is_online = ?', $_GET['online']);
```

Of course you can use multiple conditions:

```php
<?php

$model->where('is_online = ? AND is_home_excluded = ?', $_GET['online'], false);
```

`and()` is alias to `where()` and should be prefered when linking adding conditions:

```php
<?php

$model->where('is_online = ?', $_GET['online'])->and('is_home_excluded = ?', false);
```





#### Conditions specified as an array (or list of arguments)

Conditions can also be specified as arrays:

```php
<?php

$model->where([ 'is_online' => $_GET['online'], 'is_home_excluded' => false ]);
```





#### Subset conditions

Records belonging to a subset can be retrieved using an array as condition value:

```php
<?php

$model->where([ 'orders_count' => [ 1,3,5 ] ]);
```

This generates something like: `... WHERE (orders_count IN (1,3,5))`.





#### Modifiers

When conditions are specified as an array it is possible to modify the comparing function.
Prefixing a field name with an exclamation mark uses the _not equal_ operator.

The following example demonstrates how to search for records where the `order_count` field is
different than "2":

```php
<?php

$model->where([ '!order_count' => 2 ]);
```

```
â€¦ WHERE `order_count` != 2
```

This also works with subsets:

```php
<?php

$model->where([ '!order_count' => [ 1,3,5 ] ]);
```

```
â€¦ WHERE `order_count` NOT IN(1, 3, 5)
```





#### Dynamic filters

Conditions can also be specified as methods, prefixed by `filter_by_` and separated by `_and_`:

```php
<?php

$model->filter_by_slug('creer-nuage-mots-cle');
$model->filter_by_is_online_and_uid(true, 3);
```

Is equivalent to:

```php
<?php

$model->where([ 'slug' => 'creer-nuage-mots-cle' ]);
$model->where([ 'is_online' => true, 'uid' => 3 ]);
```





#### Scopes

Scopes can be viewed as model defined filters. Models can define their own filters,
inherit filters from their parent class and override them. For instance, this is how a
`similar_site`, `similar_language` and `visible` scopes could be defined:

```php
<?php

namespace Website\Nodes;

use ICanBoogie\Core;
use ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord\Query;

class Model extends \ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord\Model
{
	// â€¦

	protected function scope_similar_site(Query $query, $siteid=null)
	{
		return $query->and('siteid = 0 OR siteid = ?', $siteid !== null ? $siteid : Core::get()->site->siteid);
	}

	protected function scope_similar_language(Query $query, $language=null)
	{
		return $query->and('language = "" OR language = ?', $language !== null ? $language : Core::get()->site->language);
	}

	protected function scope_visible(Query $query, $visible=true)
	{
		return $query->similar_site->similar_language->filter_by_is_online($visible);
	}

	// â€¦
}
```

Now you can easily retrieve the first ten records that are visible on your website:

```php
<?php

$model->visible->limit(10);
```

Or retrieve the first ten french records:

```php
<?php

$model->similar_language('fr')->limit(10);
```





### Ordering

The `order()` method retrieves records in a specific order.

The following example demonstrates how to get records in the ascending order of their creation
date:

```php
<?php

$model->order('created');
```

A direction can be specified:

```php
<?php

$model->order('created ASC');
# or
$model->order('created DESC');
```

Multiple fields can be used while ordering:

```php
<?php

$model->order('created DESC, title');
```

Records can also be ordered by field:

```php
<?php

$model->where([ 'nid' => [ 1, 2, 3 ] ])->order('nid', [ 2, 3, 1 ]);
# or
$model->where([ 'nid' => [ 1, 2, 3 ] ])->order('nid', 2, 3, 1);
```





### Grouping data

The `group()` method specifies the `GROUP BY` clause.

The following example demonstrates how to retrieve the first record of records grouped by day:

```php
<?php

$model->group('date(created)')->order('created');
```





#### Filtering groups

The `having()` method specifies the `HAVING` clause, which specifies the conditions of the
`GROUP BY` clause.

The following example demonstrates how to retrieve the first record created by day for the past
month:

```php
<?php

$model->group('date(created)')->having('created > ?', date('Y-m-d', strtotime('-1 month')))->order('created')
```





### Limit and offset

The `limit()` method limits the number of records to retrieve.

```php
<?php

$model->limit(10); // retrieves the first 10 records
```

With two arguments, an offset can be specified:

```php
<?php

$model->limit(5, 10); // retrieves records from the 6th to the 16th
```

The offset can also be defined using the `offset()` method:

```php
<?php

$model->offset(5); // retrieves records from the 6th to the last
$model->limit(10)->offset(5);
```





### Selecting specific fields

By default all fields are selected (`SELECT *`) and records are instances of the [ActiveRecord](http://icanboogie.org/docs/namespace-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.html)
class defined by the model. The `select()` method selects only a subset of fields from
the result set, in which case each row of the result set is returned as an array, unless a fetch
mode is defined.

The following example demonstrates how to get the identifier, creation date and title of records:

```php
<?php

$model->select('nid, created, title');
```

Because the `SELECT` string is used _as is_ to build the query, complex SQL statements can be
used:

```php
<?php

$model->select('nid, created, CONCAT_WS(":", title, language)');
```





### Joining tables

The `joins()` method specifies the `JOIN` clause. A raw string or a model identifier
can be used to specify the join. The method can be used multiple times to create multiple joins.





#### Joining tables using a raw string

A join can be specified using a raw string, which will be included _as is_ in the final SQL
statement.

```php
<?php

$model->joins('INNER JOIN `contents` USING(`nid`)');
```





#### Joining tables using a model identifier

A join can be specified using a model identifier, in which case relationship between models
are used to create the join:

```php
<?php

$model->joins(':contents');
```

The same SQL statement will be created, but we don't have to care about the join conditions. Please
notice the column ":" used to identify that a model identifier is used and not a raw fragement.

Note: The method uses the `get_model()` helper. Checkout the "Patching" section for implementation
details.





### Retrieving data

There are many ways to retrieve data. We have already seen the `find()` method, which can be used
to retrieve records using their identifier. The following methods or magic properties work with
conditions.





#### Retrieving data by iteration

Instances of [Query](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.Query.html)
are traversable, it's the easiest way the retrieve the rows of the result set:

```php
<?php

foreach ($model->where('is_online = 1') as $node)
{
	// â€¦
}
```





#### Retrieving the complete result set

The magic property `all` retrieves the complete result set as an array:

```php
<?php

$array = $model->all;
$array = $model->visible->order('created DESC')->all
```

The `all()` method retrieves the complete result set using a specific fetch mode:

```php
<?php

$array = $model->all(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
$array = $model->visible->order('created DESC')->(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)
```





#### Retrieving a single record

The `one` magic property retrieves a single record:

```php
<?php

$record = $model->one;
$record = $model->visible->order('created DESC')->one
```

The `one()` method retrieves a single record using a specific fetch mode:

```php
<?php

$record = $model->one(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
$record = $model->visible->order('created DESC')->one(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
```

Note: The number of records to retrieve is automatically limited to 1.





#### Retrieving key/value pairs

The `pairs` magic property retrieves key/value pairs when selecting two columns, the first column
is the key and the second its value.

```php
<?php

$model->select('nid, title')->pairs;
```

Results are similar to the following example:

```
array
  34 => string 'CrÃ©er un nuage de mots-clÃ©' (length=28)
  57 => string 'GÃ©nÃ©rer Ã  la volÃ©e des miniatures avec mise en cache' (length=56)
  307 => string 'Mes premiers pas de dÃ©veloppeur sous Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx)' (length=63)
  ...
```





#### Retrieve the first column of the first row

The `rc` magic property retrieves the first colunm of the first row.

```php
<?php

$title = $model->select('title')->rc;
```

Note: The number of records to retrieve is automatically limited to 1.





### Defining the fetch mode

The fetch mode is usually selected by the query interface but the `mode` can be used to specify
it.

```php
<?php

$model->select('nid, title')->mode(\PDO::FETCH_NUM);
```

The `mode()` method accepts the same arguments as the
[PDOStatement::setFetchMode](http://php.net/manual/fr/pdostatement.setfetchmode.php) method.

As we have seen in previous examples, the fetch mode can also be specified when fetching data
with the `all()` and `one()` methods.

```php
<?php

$array = $model->order('created DESC')->all(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
$record = $model->order('created DESC')->one(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
```





### Checking the existence of records

The `exists()` method checks the existence of a record, it queries the database just like `find()`
but returns `true` when a record is found and `false` otherwise.

```php
<?php

$model->exists(1);
```

The method accepts multiple identifiers in which case it returns `true` when all the
records exist, `false` when all the record don't exist, and an array otherwise.

```php
<?php

$model->exists(1, 2, 999)
# or
$model->exists([ 1, 2, 999 ]);
```

The method would return the following result if records "1" and "2" exist but not record "999".

```
array
  1 => boolean true
  2 => boolean true
  999 => boolean false
```

The `exists` magic property is `true` if at least one record matching the specified conditions
exists, `false` otherwise.

```php
<?php

$model->filter_by_author('Madonna')->exists;
```

The `exists` magic property of the model is `true` if the modal has at least one record, `false`
otherwise.

```php
<?php

$model->exists;
```





### Counting

The `count` magic property is the number of records in a model or matching a query.

```php
<?php

$model->count;
```

Or on a query:

```php
<?php

$model->filter_by_firstname('Ryan')->count;
```

Of course, all query methods can be combined:

```php
<?php

$model->filter_by_firstname('Ryan')->joins(':content')->where('YEAR(date) = 2011')->count;
```

The `count()` method returns an array with the number of recond for each value of a field:

```php
<?php

$model->count('is_online');
```

```
array
  0 => string '35' (length=2)
  1 => string '145' (length=3)
```

In this example, there is 35 record online and 145 offline.





### Calculations

The `average()`, `minimum()`, `maximum()` and `sum()` method are respectively used, for a column,
to compute its average value, its minimum value, its maximum value and its sum.

All calculation methods work directly on the model:

```php
<?php

$model->average('price');
```

And on a query:

```php
<?php

$model->filter_by_category('Toys')->average('price');
```

Of course, all query methods can be combined:

```php
<?php

$model->filter_by_category('Toys')->joins(':content')->where('YEAR(date) = 2011')->average('price');
```





### Query interface summary

Retrieving records:

```php
<?php

$record = $model[10];
# or
$record = $model->find(10);

$records = $model->find(10, 15, 19);
# or
$records = $model->find([ 10, 15, 19 ]);

## Providers

Providers are included to manage connections and models.





### The connections provider

The connections provider manages database connections.





#### Defining connections

Connection definitions can be specified while creating the [Connections][]
instance.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord\Connections;

$connections = new Connections
([
	'one' => [

		'dsn' => 'sqlite::memory:'
	],

	'bad' => [

		'dsn' => 'mysql:dbname=bad_database' . uniqid()
	]
]);
```

Or after:

```php
<?php

$connections['two'] = [

	'dsn' => 'mysql:dbname=example',
	'username' => 'root',
	'password' => 'root'
];
```

You can modify a connection definition until it is established. A [ConnectionAlreayEstablished](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.ConnectionAlreadyEstablished.html)
exception is thrown in attempt to modify the definition of an already established connection.





#### Obtaining a database connection

[Connections][] instances
are used as arrays. For instance, this is how you obtain a [Connection](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.Connection.html)
instance, which represent a database connection:

```php
<?php

$one = $connections['one'];
```

Database connections are created on demand, so that you can define a hundred of them and they
will only be established when needed.

A [ConnectionNotDefined](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.ConnectionNotDefined.html)
exception is thrown in attempt to obtain a connection that is not defined.





#### Checking defined connections

Because [Connections][] instances are used as arrays, the `isset()` function is used to check
if a connection is defined.

```php
<?php

if (isset($connections['one']))
{
	echo "The connection 'one' is defined.\n";
}
```

The `definitions` magic property returns the current connection definitions. The property is
_read-only_.

```php
<?php

foreach ($connections->definitions as $id => $definition)
{
	echo "The connection '$id' is defined.\n";
}
```





#### Established connections

An array with the established connections can be retrieved using the `established` magic property.
The property is _read-only_.

```php
<?php

foreach ($connections->established as $id => $connection)
{
	echo "The connection '$id' is established.\n";
}
```

The [Connections] instance itself can be used to traverse established connections.

```php
<?php

foreach ($connections as $id => $connection)
{
	echo "The connection '$id' is established.\n";
}
```





### The models provider

The models provider manages models.





#### Defining models

Model definitions can be specified while creating the [Models](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.Models.html)
instance.

Note: You don't have to create the [Connection](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.Connection.html)
intances used by the models, you can use their identifier which will get resolved when the
model is needed.

Note: If `CONNECTION` is not specified the `primary` connection is used.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord\Model;
use ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord\Models;

$models = new Models($connections, [

	'nodes' => [

		// â€¦
		Model::SCHEMA => [

			'nid' => 'serial',
			'title' => 'varchar'
			// â€¦
		]
	],

	'contents' => [

		// â€¦
		Model::EXTENDING => 'nodes'
	]
]);
```

Model definitions can be modified or added after the [Models](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.Models.html)
instance has been created.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord\Model;

$models['new'] = [

	// â€¦
	Model::EXTENDING => 'contents'
];
```

You can modify the definition of a model until it is instantiated. A
[ModelAlreadyInstantiated](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.ModelAlreadyInstantiated.html)
exception is thrown in attempt to modify the definition of an already instantiated model.





#### Obtaining a model

Use the [Models](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.Models.html) instance
as an array to obtain a [Model](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.Model.html) instance.

```php
<?php

$nodes = $models['nodes'];
```

Models are instantiated on demand, so that you can define a hundred models an they will only by
instantiated, along with their database connection, when needed.

A [ModelNotDefined](http://icanboogie.org/docs/class-ICanBoogie.ActiveRecord.ModelNotDefined.html)
exception is thrown in attempts to obtain a model which is not defined.





#### Checking defined models

The `isset()` function checks if a model is defined.

```php
<?php

if (isset($models['nodes']))
{
	echo "The model 'node' is defined.\n";
}
```

The `definitions` magic property returns the current model definitions. The property is
_read-only_.

```php
<?php

foreach ($models->definitions as $id => $definition)
{
	echo "The model '$id' is defined.\n";
}
```





#### Instantiated models

An array with the instantiated models can be retrieved using the `instances` magic property. The
property is _read-only_.

```php
<?php

foreach ($models->instances as $id => $model)
{
	echo "The model '$id' has been instantiated.\n";
}
```





## Records caching

By default, each model uses an instance of [RunTimeActiveRecordCache][] to cache its records.
This cache stores the records for the duration of the request, it is brand new with each HTTP
request. The cache is obtained using the prototype features of the model, through the
`activerecord_cache` magic property.

Third parties can provide a different cache instance simply by overriding the
`lazy_get_activerecord_cache` method:

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord\Model;
use ICanBoogie\Prototype;

Prototype::from('ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord\Model')['lazy_get_activerecord_cache'] = function(Model $model) {

	return new MyActiveRecordCache($model);

};
```

Or using the `hooks` configuration:

```php
<?php

// config/hooks.php

return [

	'prototypes' => [

		'ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord\Model::lazy_get_activerecord_cache' => 'my_activerecord_cache_provider'

	]

];
```






## Patching

### Retrieving models from a provider

The `get_model()` helper retrieves models using their identifier. It is used by active
records to retrieve their model when required, and by queries during joins. You need to patch
this helper according to your application logic because the default implementation only throws
`\RuntimeException`.

In the following example, the `get_model()` helper is patched to retrieve models from a provider
similar to the one we've seen in previous examples.

```php
<?php

use ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord;
use ICanBoogie\ActiveRecord\Helpers;

Helpers::patch('get_model', function($id) use($models) {

	return $models[$id];

});

$nodes = ActiveRecord\get_model('nodes');
```





## Auto-config

The package supports the auto-config feature of the framework [ICanBoogie][] and provides
the following:

- A synthesizer for the `activerecord_connections` config, created from the `activerecord`
fragments.
- A lazy getter for the `ICanBoogie\Core::$connections` property, that return a [Connections][]
instance created with the `activerecord_connections` config.
- A lazy getter for the `ICanBoogie\Core::$db` property, that return the connection named
`primary` from the `ICanBoogie\Core::$connections` property.





### The `activerecord` config

Currently `activerecord` fragments are used synthesize the `activerecord_connections` config,
suitable to create a [Connections][] instance.

The following is an example of a config that defines two connections: `primary` is a connection
to the MySQL server; `cache` is a connection to a SQLite database:

```php
<?php

// config/activerecord.php

return [

	'connections' => [

		'primary' => [

			'dsn' => 'mysql:dbname=mydatabase',
			'username' => 'root',
			'password' => 'root',
			'#timezone' => '+00.00',
			'#table_name_prefix' => ''

		],

		'cache' => [

			'dsn' => 'sqlite:' . ICanBoogie\REPOSITORY . 'cache.sqlite'

		]

	]

];
```
